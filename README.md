# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Models

## Background
This project utilizes four different deep learning models to classify breast cancer images into benign, malignant, and normal categories. The purpose of doing this project is for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. By accurately categorizing cancer types, healthcare providers can determine the best course of action, improving patient outcomes. Classification also aids in understanding tumor behavior, enabling personalized therapies and reducing unnecessary treatments. This contributes to better survival rates and overall patient care.

## Result and Discussion
- The result shows that the ViT (Pre-Trained) model achieved the highest accuracy in classifying breast cancer ultrasound images into three classes (Benign, Malignant, Normal), with an accuracy of 92%.

  - Freezing different number of layers
  - Compare the accuracy between baseline and fine-tuning (freeze layers)
